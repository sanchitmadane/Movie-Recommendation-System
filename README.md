# Movie-Recommendation-System
A movie recommendation system is a personalized tool that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. It employs various algorithms to analyze user data and provide movie suggestions that align with their interests. The system typically involves these steps:

*  Data Collection: Gather data on movies, user ratings, genres, and other relevant information.

*  User Profiling: Build profiles for users based on their past movie ratings, genres they prefer, and any other available information.

*  Feature Extraction: Transform movie and user data into numerical features that algorithms can work with.
*  Algorithm Selection: Choose recommendation algorithms such as collaborative filtering (user-based or item-based), content-based filtering (using movie attributes), matrix factorization, or hybrid methods.


*  Training: Train the chosen algorithm using the available user-movie interaction data   
*  
Prediction: Generate movie recommendations for users by predicting how they might rate or interact with different movies.


*  Evaluation: Measure the effectiveness of the recommendations using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or user engagement
